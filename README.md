# Classification and clustering of smartphones based on physical sensor data

## Context
This is my Captsone project for Udacity's _Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree_. It was made with the collaboration of CONTXTFUL, the company that supplied my data set.

## Goal
In this project, the primary goal is to identify smartphones' make-model based solely on their physical sensor data. This can be measured by a F1 score.

As a secondary target, it would be interesting to cluster the phones and see if a natural separation of the samples occurs based on their make-models. This can be measured by weighting the representation of each phone make-models into the clusters.

## Tools
The main code is located in Solution.ipynb. It is written in Python 3. All the libraries used are publicly available through `pip install`, except for the custom support module called Utilities.py.

Utilities.py, as well as the data set, the project description and the project report, are all available in this repo.
